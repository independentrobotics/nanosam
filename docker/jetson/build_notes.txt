To build on a Jetson, at least with current Jetpack version, 
you need to export DOCKER_BUILDKIT=0 to turn off the Docker buildkit, because
it somehow disables the Nvidia Container Toolkit and makes it impossible for the 
container to access CUDA, TensorRT, etc. 

When building on a Jetson device with less than 16GB of video memory, 
you're going to need to set up a swap file, or the conversion of ONXX
models into TensorRT Engines will fail, somewhat silently.
