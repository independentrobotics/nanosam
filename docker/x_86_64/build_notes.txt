To build on a desktop/laptop system, follow these steps.

0. Ensure that the Docker engine is installed and that the nvidia-container-toolkit is installed and configured.
1. Run `./build_image.bash [path_to_folder_containing_ir_utils]`
2. That's it! Note that if you don't have TRT engines for SAM already in your ir_utils directory, 
your first launch of the Docker container will build these, as Docker cannot access the GPU during the build process.
